Personal collection of scripts for Aseprite.
Mostly for experimenting and will be improved/updated if I have new ideas coming.

# Run scripts

2. Go to `File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder`
3. Place scripts into opened directory
4. Restart Aseprite or rescan the scripts folder
4. Go to `File > Scripts` again and select the script that should be executed
